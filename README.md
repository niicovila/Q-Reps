## About this work (in progress)
A study of regularized reinforcement learning algorithms from both a MaxEntRL and a Linear Programming framework. Specially studying the implementation of the QREPS algorithm in large scale environments using DNNs.

In main, you will find the three main algorithms I'm currently working on.

### Provisional Results:
#### QREPS
Fast convergence in LunarLander and CartPole (for now).
